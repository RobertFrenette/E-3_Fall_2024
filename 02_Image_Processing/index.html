      <h4>6. Image processing (array handling) </h4>
      <p>The image below is appearing inside an HTML canvas element.&nbsp; We'll
        learn more about canvas elements later in the course, but for now, the
        important thing to know is that, unlike an image displayed normally in
        the browser using the IMG tag, the image data that appears in a canvas
        element is available to Javascript as a "bitmap". </p>
      <p>The bitmap data is an array that maps four numbers to each pixel in the
        image: r, g, b, a, where r, g, b are integer values from 0 to 255 which
        describe red, green, and blue respectively; and a, which is an 'alpha'
        value between 0 and 255 in which 0 is transparent and 255 is completely
        opaque. Since there are four array elements for each pixel, the total
        array will contain pixels_in_image * 4 elements in all. </p>
      <p>The first pixel's red data is at data[0], the second pixel's red data
        at data[4], etc. </p>
      <p>Your job is to write additional code inside the function that will
        modify the image data to create a new version, as described below
        and in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">js/hw2ArrayImageProcessing.js</span>
        file.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Important Note: To do this exercise using your local file
          system (with no Web server involved), you will need to use Firefox as
          your browser. Chrome will display an error due to security
          constraints.</strong> </p>
